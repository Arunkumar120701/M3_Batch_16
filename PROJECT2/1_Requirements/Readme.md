# Description

• Remote Keyless entry systems allow you to unlock and lock the doors to your vehicle without using a key. It is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock.

# Identifying features

• Car should get LOCK when the Button is pressed ONCE

• Car should get UNLOCK when the Button is pressed TWICE

. Car should get ACTIVATION/DEACTIVATION alarm when the Button is pressed THREE times

. Car should get APPROACH LIGHT when the Button is pressed FOUR times

# SWOT ANALYSIS:

## STRENGTHS:

> RKE-actuated vehicle-immobilization technology minimizes car theft.

> There is no human interaction with the car as it is keyless.

> Every function is managed by the buttons on the remote.

## WEAKNESS:

> A remote can stop working because of dead battery & reprogramming of the remote can also be needed.

> Two or more commands cannot be functioned at the same time.

## OPPORTUNITIES:

> The RKE systems has a huge cope in automobiles as the RKE system can be programmed in such a way to handle/protect the automobiles from panics, like noise other than car theft by activating new features like alarms in it.

> Enabling RKE systems in vehicles not only improves security of car access but also facilitates convenience to the users.

> Reasonable cost.

## THREATS:

> RKE system introduces many threats like key fob cloning, jamming, & so on.
