# RKE { REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY }


 Remote Keyless entry systems allow you to unlock and lock the doors to your vehicle without using a key. It is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock.
