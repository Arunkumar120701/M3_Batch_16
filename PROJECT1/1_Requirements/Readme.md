# INTRODUCTION 

This BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. Here the bi-directional communication takes place in between the keyfob and the car. As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directionaL. Information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display.

# DISCRIPTION

Description Keyless remotes contain a short-range radio transmitter, and must be within a certain range, usually 5-20 meters, of the car to work. When a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by radio waves to a receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door. This is dual communication system where the vehicle sends the car battery info, window, door and alarm status to the user. Most RKES operate at a frequency of 315 MHz for North America-made cars and at 433.92 MHz for European, Japanese and Asian cars. When you press a button on your key fob, you're waking up its Central Processing Unit (CPU) inside. The CPU sends a data stream to the radio frequency (RF) transmitter. The keyless remote is actually a radio.This data stream contains command and for security, rolling codes. The remote keyless system's receiver in the car captures the RF signal, extracts it and sends the data stream to the CPU. The CPU decodes it and sends commands to the command module. The toggling of LEDs happen according to the command. The functions of a remote keyless entry system are contained on a key fob. Buttons are dedicated to locking or unlocking the doors. Some remote keyless fobs also feature a red panic button which activates the car alarm as a standard feature.Description Keyless remotes contain a short-range radio transmitter, and must be within a certain range, usually 5-20 meters, of the car to work.

# APPLICATIONS

* Bi-directional communication makes this possible. When the door handle is pulled (or some similar trigger is activated) the base unit located within the vehicle emits a short range, low frequency signal- polling for a nearby key fob transponder.

* if present, the key fob recognizes the signal and responds with a UHF (ultra-high frequency) signal, transmitting a code to be authenticated by the base unit encryption firmware, such as Microchip Technology's Keylock.

* Remote keyless entry systems, now fairly commonplace devices, provide car owners with a degree of convenience, making the task of physically inserting a key unnecessary.
