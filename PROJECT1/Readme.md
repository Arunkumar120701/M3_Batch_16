# BICOM-SYSTEM



This BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. Here the bi-directional communication takes place in between the keyfob and the car. As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directionaL. Information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display.
